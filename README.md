# Harvard Square

This side project was first conceived when I read my friend's blog on book reviews, and thought that the accordion developed in [cryptoy](https://github.com/walnutdust/crypto) could help her both 1) express her thoughts more succinctly, 2) allow the readers of her blog to open up the accordion to view quotes or greater elaboration that support her points.

Since WordPress (free) does not allow for the linking of external Javascript, I thought of replicating her website onto GitHub and hosting it here, since it provided much greater freedom for me to manipulate with the elements. To provide the best user experience, I decided to fully replicate all the static elements from her blog onto this make-up, with functioning links, so that the reader does not get a jarring feeling that comes from viewing different UIs.

The challenging part of the project was working with HTML & CSS to probe them to give me the output I wanted. Where possible, I prevented myself from viewing the source code (except to get the colour values, links, and other areas requiring exact numbers), in order to gain greater familiarity as to how the various elements interacted with each other (say, the various display values, making horizontal lists with custom list markers, etc).
