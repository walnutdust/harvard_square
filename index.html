        Andre Aciman’s Call Me by Your Name is striking for its brilliant
        characterizations, but even more so for his delicate and sensitive writing
        style. It was for this reason that I became intrigued in his other works
        and that this novel, a more biographical work that deals with identity
        and relationships caught my eye.
        <br /><br />
        Harvard Square is a first person narrative about a young man during his
        summer and the following school year at Harvard University when he working
        towards completing a doctorate in English Literature. The summer is dull,
        dreary, and dry. It’s too hot and for all its furiously academic reputation,
        Harvard Square is a drought, all of its scholars having departed.
        The narrator, though clearly in love with his pursuits, is a little
        disgruntled. Having failed his comprehensives for the first time, and
        feeling like a social pariah because of his immigrant status, he spends
        the summer in a limbo, calling into question his identity, perspectives,
        and mindset.
        <br /><br />
        At the core, this is a story about the narrator. The central story arc is
        bookended by the plot that occurs in the distant future, when the narrator
        is back with his son for a college visit and revisiting his old haunts with
        more than a little nostalgia. However, the plot really revolves around the
        second central character, a taxi driver named Kalashnikov, or Kalaj.
        The story’s arc is defined by the narrator’s constantly changing relationship
        with this second man. In fact, although the timeframe of the narrative is
        loosely defined by this uncertain period of time in the narrator’s life,
        it’s more specifically defined in terms of his relationship with Kalaj.
        The story begins upon their meeting, rising to its peaks and depths in
        accordance to the ebbs and flows of his relationship with him. Though
        there are other events outside of Kalaj that influence the course of the
        narrator’s story, most of the time their impact on him is influenced in
        some way by how he is feeling about Kalaj at the time. The substance of
        the novel hinges on their relationship; the narrator interprets and
        reinterprets his life because of the new ideas Kalaj presents to him,
        and interprets and reinterprets Kalaj because of those same ideas. He
        sympathizes with him, looks down upon him, loves him, hates him, is inspired
        by him, is ashamed of him, and identifies with him. At times Kalaj is his
        lifeline, his only confidant, at times his enemy, an unwanted reminder of
        his past. Even with the final line in the novel, the narrator redefines his
        relationship with him, confused about whether to look back on their time
        together with fondness or disgust.
        <br /><br />
        The chapters when the narrator first meets Kalaj are fascinating, both
        because of the extraordinarily complex character that Aciman brings to
        life, as well as because of how this new character creates such a
        disturbance in the narrator’s thoughts. This “first encounter,” in which
        the narrator first perceives the existence of Kalaj and attempts to
        understand him, categorize him, pigeonhole him, lasts for the entire
        first chapter, and indeed throughout the entire novel to some extent.
        Indeed, he leaves behind mere adjectives in his attempts to describe
        him—adjectives cannot suffice to fully encompass Kalaj’s character.
        Instead, he fixates on example after example, proof and counterproof,
        all in a vain attempt to reveal all of the various contradictory factors
        that make up Kalaj’s being. This digestion of his personality and values
        continues throughout the entire novel, the narrator recharacterizing him
        over and over,

        outline him.</p></button>
      <div class = "panel">
        <p>
          In fact, when the narrator first encounters Kalaj, he begins with a
          single descriptor, one he quickly amends and replaces with an entire
          paragraph, as if he simply could not be captured any other way.
          (embedded) “He was sitting at a table not far from mine, speaking French.
          Correction: he wasn’t speaking. He didn’t speak; instead, he rapid-fired
          machine-gun style, in bursts and sputters. Rat-tat-tat, he took down
          civilization, Western and Eastern, no difference, he hated them both.
          Cranky, jittery, crazed, strafing his way from one subject to the next—it
          didn’t matter which—he’d mow it down. Rat-tat-tat, like shattered glass
          spun in a blender. Rat-tat-tat, like a jackhammer, like a chainsaw, like
          a power drill, every syllable spiked with venom, vengeance, and vitriol”
          (23).
        </p>

          <p>
            Before the narrator’s meeting with Kalaj, his life is extraordinarily
            bland. He is in a state of unmotivation and uncertainty, drifting
            through the long summer days preoccupied by equal parts disinterest
            and confusion. Though this characterization of the narrator is accurate
            and helps describe his original mindset, the purpose of such great
            emphasis being placed on the slow pace of his life is double. To put
            it simply, the narrator’s life is boring. Therefore, the book is also
            boring. However, the reader is reading a novel, and thus is waiting
            for the other shoe to drop. Perhaps the narrator is not, but there is
            still a distinct sense of waiting that permeates the first part of the
            first chapter. On his part, the narrator is waiting for his life to
            become more interesting, for the interminable summer to drag to an
            end, for something or someone to turn up. In a particularly illustrative
            moment, he muses that “Nursing a drink is one thing. But watching your
            ice cubes melt and turn the watered-down brew into a clear soup and
            still pretend that your glass is half full was like trying to preserve
            the polar ice-caps with a paper fan” (23), a statement tinged with a
            wry self awareness. However, what that “something” is becomes clear
            in the next line.
            <br /><br />
            Aciman announces to the reader to pay attention with the abrupt,
            staccato line “Then I heard him” (23). The sentences that follow are
            a far cry from the winding sentences that preceded them, as if stretching
            and lengthening to fill the endless time and space. Instead, they are
            pithy, jarring, fragmented. The narrator looks over at a man sitting
            at the table adjacent to him, and his thoughts suddenly emerge in
            structures tinged with overtones of Kalaj does not talk, he spits.
            The words that come out of him are not elegant or gentle, but compact
            bullets that puncture and rattle out of his machine gun mouth rapid
            fire.
          </p>

              Then I heard him. He was sitting at a table not far from mine,
              speaking French. Correction: he wasn’t speaking. He didn’t speak;
              instead, he rapid-fired machine-gun style, in bursts and sputters.

              <br /><br />
              Between the short, jagged sentences, there are no conjunctions,
              creating a sense of haphazard frenzy. When observing him, the
              narrator’s thoughts shorten and become abrupt, short clauses strung
              together in a line to punch like bullets. Adjectives fly, throwing
              a brief spotlight on one facet only to disappear in favor of another,
              as if the narrator keeps trying and failing to find a word that truly
              fits. In addition, Aciman often uses isocolon, repetition of beginnings
              of sentences, to disrupt his train of thought. “Rat-tat-tat...Rat-tat-tat,”
              Aciman fixates upon the strafing, machine gun nature of Kalaj’s speech.

          <p>
              Kalaj enters the narrator’s life, and suddenly the subject of the
              book makes sense. Kalaj is the “something” that the narrator and
              the reader have been waiting for, the vermillion streak on a
              monochromatic canvas.
              <br /><br />
              Aciman is incredibly talented in his ability to create a character
              with extraordinarily transparent thought processes, a skill also
              evident in Call Me By Your Name. The main character’s voice is the
              most captivating aspect of this novel. Self aware and critical, the
              narrator’s inner monologue is reflective and analytical, in a state
              of constant self examination and uncertainty. This entire stream of
              consciousness is fascinating for the reader to sift through and
              examine closely. He represents the most unreliable of narrators—
          </p>


          <div class = "panel">
            <p>
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class = "accordion"><p>one who lies to himself both consciously
            and unconsciously and calls upon the reader to cross examine his cross
            examinations. </p></button>
          <div class = "panel">
            <p>
              Throughout the first chapter and continuing through the remainder
              of the novel, the narrator gives the impression that he is fully
              honest with himself, when in fact the lines are more blurry. Kalaj
              beguiles away the narrator’s senses and attracts him immeasurably,
              to the narrator’s astonishment and bewilderment. The narrator mentions,
              “If I did help him, as I did when I spent hours coaching him for his i
              nterview with Immigration Services, it was probably either without
              thinking or because I couldn’t come up with a good enough excuse not
              to” (59). He omits that he finds Kalaj fascinating, leaving the
              evidence of his own actions to a vague and blatantly ambiguous
              “couldn’t come up with a good enough excuse.”
              <br /><br />
              For the reader, these small lies embedded in the thoughts swirling
              around the narrator’s consciousness are interesting to observe;
              perhaps they are more revealing of his personality than the truths
              that he admits.
            </p>
          </div>

          With this incredible voice the narrator considers and discusses the
          shifts in his perspective and mindset, both small and large, that occur
          because of his relationship with Kalaj. For the narrator, Kalaj

          <div class = "panel">
            <p>
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class = "accordion"><p>takes on a wide variety of personas and
            roles, ranging from confidant, to stranger, to lover. </p></button>
          <div class = "panel">
            <p>
              The narrator finds in Kalaj a kindred spirit whose likes he has
              never encountered before. They align emotionally closely in many
              respects, understanding each other without words. One of the first
              exchanges that occurs between them is brilliant and reveals this
              perfectly:
              <br /><br />
              “He was playing with me. I knew he wasn’t French, just as he must
              have immediately guessed I wasn’t either. Each was basically letting
              the other think he could pass for French. A tacit compliment that
              hit the mark in both of us...We understood each other perfectly”
              (30). The narrator and Kalaj find themselves alone in an oasis of
              calm in the eye of a foreign country, Café Algiers a safe haven for
              each man to hide from their fears and alter egos, where they can
              each feign for a moment at least that they belong. If not to a place,
              then with another person.
              <br /><br />
              On the other hand, while in Kalaj the narrator finds a spirit close
              to his heart, he manages at the same time to be completely alien
              to the narrator.
              <br /><br />
              After Kalaj lures the narrator in and cements their friendship with
              a round of coffee, the narrator observes, “I was the exact opposite
              [kind of person]. Interest in other people came naturally enough
              [for me]; but it came the long way around, with so many bends,
              hurdles, doubts, and deferrals that halfway toward a friendship,
              discouragement and disappointment would invariably settle in, and
              something in me would simply give up” (32). Reflecting upon his
              social ineptitude, the narrator muses, “Never had I felt so useless
              and callow in ordinary day-to-day affairs. I was a flea tagging after
              a titan” (45).
              </p>
          </div>

          However, as the story progresses and the narrator spends more and more
          time with Kalaj, he gradually comes to the realization although Kalaj
          has a startling polarity to his personality, for all their differences
          the reason why he feels such a strong attraction and deep understanding
          with him is that in him

          <div class = "panel">
            <p>
              <br /><br />
              In a later passage, the narrator states difference after difference
              between himself and that disheveled cabbie. However, with every word
              the thought remains, unspoken, that despite each and every one of
              those divisions the narrator sees himself clearly in the other man.
            </p>
          </div>

          <br /><br />
          Aciman’s portrayal of Kalaj as the narrator’s foil in a most literal
          sense is excellent. Throughout the novel’s introduction to this character,
          the narrator goes through a spectrum of reactions, pulling the reader along
          in his slapdash assessments of Kalaj until it slowly dawns on him that
          this bedraggled caricature of a man is really him.
          Harvard Square is a masterpiece that manages to cut to the core of the identity
          crisis relevant to anyone struggling to fit into a new society and set of
          expectations. Aciman paints the characters in the story of the narrator’s
          life with beautiful strokes and winding prose that helps the reader
          empathize and resonate with the central storyline on a level that strikes
          extremely deeply. A narrative that struggles with class differences, race
          differences, identity, and relationships, Aciman captures perfectly the
          meandering hopes and fears eminently relatable to anyone feeling a little
          loss in this day and age.
