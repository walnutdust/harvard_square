              Andre Aciman’s <i>Call Me by Your Name</i> is striking for its brilliant
              characterizations, but even more so for his delicate and sensitive writing
              style. It was for this reason that I became intrigued in his other works
              and that this novel, a more biographical work that deals with identity
              and relationships caught my eye.
              <br /><br />
              <i>Harvard Square</i> is a first person narrative about a young man during his
              summer and the following school year at Harvard University when he working
              towards completing a doctorate in English Literature. The summer is dull,
              dreary, and dry. It’s too hot and for all its furiously academic reputation,
              Harvard Square is a drought, all of its scholars having departed.
              The narrator, though clearly in love with his pursuits, is a little
              disgruntled. Having failed his comprehensives for the first time, and
              feeling like a social pariah because of his immigrant status, he spends
              the summer in a limbo, calling into question his identity, perspectives,
              and mindset.
              <br /><br />
              At the core, this is a story about the narrator. The central story arc is
              bookended by the plot that occurs in the distant future, when the narrator
              is back with his son for a college visit and revisiting his old haunts with
              more than a little nostalgia. However, the plot really revolves around the
              second central character, a taxi driver named Kalashnikov, or Kalaj.
              The story’s arc is defined by the narrator’s constantly changing relationship
              with this second man. In fact, although the timeframe of the narrative is
              loosely defined by this uncertain period of time in the narrator’s life,
              it’s more specifically defined in terms of his relationship with Kalaj.
              The story begins upon their meeting, rising to its peaks and depths in
              accordance to the ebbs and flows of his relationship with him. Though
              there are other events outside of Kalaj that influence the course of the
              narrator’s story, most of the time their impact on him is influenced in
              some way by how he is feeling about Kalaj at the time. The substance of
              the novel hinges on their relationship; the narrator interprets and
              reinterprets his life because of the new ideas Kalaj presents to him,
              and interprets and reinterprets Kalaj because of those same ideas. He
              sympathizes with him, looks down upon him, loves him, hates him, is inspired
              by him, is ashamed of him, and identifies with him. At times Kalaj is his
              lifeline, his only confidant, at times his enemy, an unwanted reminder of
              his past. Even with the final line in the novel, the narrator redefines his
              relationship with him, confused about whether to look back on their time
              together with fondness or disgust.
              <br /><br />
              The chapters when the narrator first meets Kalaj are fascinating, both
              because of the extraordinarily complex character that Aciman brings to
              life, as well as because of how this new character creates such a
              disturbance in the narrator’s thoughts. This “first encounter,” in which
              the narrator first perceives the existence of Kalaj and attempts to
              understand him, categorize him, pigeonhole him, lasts for the entire
              first chapter, and indeed throughout the entire novel to some extent.
              Indeed, he leaves behind mere adjectives in his attempts to describe
              him—adjectives cannot suffice to fully encompass Kalaj’s character.
              Instead, he fixates on example after example, proof and counterproof,
              all in a vain attempt to reveal all of the various contradictory factors
              that make up Kalaj’s being. This digestion of his personality and values
              continues throughout the entire novel, the narrator recharacterizing him
              over and over, pondering all of the
            </p>

            <div class = "panel">

                <br /><br />
                In fact, when the narrator first encounters Kalaj, he begins with a
                single descriptor, one he quickly amends and replaces with an entire
                paragraph, as if he simply could not be captured any other way.
                “He was sitting at a table not far from mine, speaking French.
                Correction: he wasn’t speaking. He didn’t speak; instead, he rapid-fired
                machine-gun style, in bursts and sputters. <i>Rat-tat-tat</i>, he took down
                civilization, Western and Eastern, no difference, he hated them both.
                Cranky, jittery, crazed, strafing his way from one subject to the next—it
                didn’t matter which—he’d mow it down. <i>Rat-tat-tat</i>, like shattered glass
                spun in a blender. <i>Rat-tat-tat</i>, like a jackhammer, like a chainsaw, like
                a power drill, every syllable spiked with venom, vengeance, and vitriol”
                (23).

                  <br /><br />
                  Before the narrator’s meeting with Kalaj, his life is extraordinarily
                  bland. He is in a state of unmotivation and uncertainty, drifting
                  through the long summer days preoccupied by equal parts disinterest
                  and confusion. Though this characterization of the narrator is accurate
                  and helps describe his original mindset, the purpose of such great
                  emphasis being placed on the slow pace of his life is double. To put
                  it simply, the narrator’s life is boring. Therefore, the book is also
                  boring. However, the reader is reading a novel, and thus is waiting
                  for the other shoe to drop. Perhaps the narrator is not, but there is
                  still a distinct sense of waiting that permeates the first part of the
                  first chapter. On his part, the narrator is waiting for his life to
                  become more interesting, for the interminable summer to drag to an
                  end, for something or someone to turn up. In a particularly illustrative
                  moment, he muses that “Nursing a drink is one thing. But watching your
                  ice cubes melt and turn the watered-down brew into a clear soup and
                  still pretend that your glass is half full was like trying to preserve
                  the polar ice-caps with a paper fan” (23), a statement tinged with a
                  wry self awareness. However, what that “something” is becomes clear
                  in the next line.
                  <br /><br />
                  Aciman announces to the reader to pay attention with the abrupt,
                  staccato line “Then I heard him” (23). The sentences that follow are
                  a far cry from the winding sentences that preceded them, as if stretching
                  and lengthening to fill the endless time and space. Instead, they are
                  pithy, jarring, fragmented. The narrator looks over at a man sitting
                  at the table adjacent to him, and his thoughts suddenly emerge in
                  structures tinged with overtones of Kalaj does not talk, he spits.
                  The words that come out of him are not elegant or gentle, but compact
                  bullets that puncture and rattle out of his machine gun mouth rapid
                  fire. Aciman’s words stab and jab at the reader, asyndeton and isocolon used to

                    Then I heard him. He was sitting at a table not far from mine,
                    speaking French. Correction: he wasn’t speaking. He didn’t speak;
                    instead, he rapid-fired machine-gun style, in bursts and sputters.
                    <i>Rat-tat-tat</i>, he took down civilization, Western and Eastern, no
                    difference, he hated them both. Cranky, jittery, crazed, strafing
                    his way from one subject to the next—it didn’t matter which—he’d
                    mow it down. <i>Rat-tat-tat</i>, like shattered glass spun in a blender.
                    <i>Rat-tat-tat</i>, like a jackhammer, like a chainsaw, like a power drill,
                    every syllable spiked with venom, vengeance, and vitriol.
                    <br /><br />
                    Between the short, jagged sentences, there are no conjunctions,
                    creating a sense of haphazard frenzy. When observing him, the
                    narrator’s thoughts shorten and become abrupt, short clauses strung
                    together in a line to punch like bullets. Adjectives fly, throwing
                    a brief spotlight on one facet only to disappear in favor of another,
                    as if the narrator keeps trying and failing to find a word that truly
                    fits. In addition, Aciman often uses isocolon, repetition of beginnings
                    of sentences, to disrupt his train of thought. “<i>Rat-tat-tat...Rat-tat-tat</i>,”
                    Aciman fixates upon the strafing, machine gun nature of Kalaj’s speech.
                  </p>

                <p>
                    <br /><br />
                    Kalaj enters the narrator’s life, and suddenly the subject of the
                    book makes sense. Kalaj is the “something” that the narrator and
                    the reader have been waiting for, the vermillion streak on a
                    monochromatic canvas.
                    <br /><br />
                    Aciman is incredibly talented in his ability to create a character
                    with extraordinarily transparent thought processes, a skill also
                    evident in Call Me By Your Name. The main character’s voice is the
                    most captivating aspect of this novel. Self aware and critical, the
                    narrator’s inner monologue is reflective and analytical, in a state
                    of constant self examination and uncertainty. This entire stream of
                    consciousness is fascinating for the reader to sift through and
                    examine closely. He represents the most unreliable of narrators—one
                    who lies to himself both consciously
                    and unconsciously and calls upon the reader to
                </p>


                <div class = "panel">

                    <br /><br />
                    Throughout the first chapter and continuing through the remainder
                    of the novel, the narrator gives the impression that he is fully
                    honest with himself, when in fact the lines are more blurry. Kalaj
                    beguiles away the narrator’s senses and attracts him immeasurably,
                    to the narrator’s astonishment and bewilderment. The narrator mentions,
                    “If I did help him, as I did when I spent hours coaching him for his i
                    nterview with Immigration Services, it was probably either without
                    thinking or because I couldn’t come up with a good enough excuse not
                    to” (59). He omits that he finds Kalaj fascinating, leaving the
                    evidence of his own actions to a vague and blatantly ambiguous
                    “couldn’t come up with a good enough excuse.”
                    <br /><br />
                    For the reader, these small lies embedded in the thoughts swirling
                    around the narrator’s consciousness are interesting to observe;
                    perhaps they are more revealing of his personality than the truths
                    that he admits.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                  <br /><br />
                  With this incredible voice the narrator considers and discusses the
                  shifts in his perspective and mindset, both small and large, that occur
                  because of his relationship with Kalaj. For the narrator, Kalaj takes
                  on a wide variety of personas and roles, ranging from
                </p>

                <div class = "panel">

                    <br /><br />
                    The narrator finds in Kalaj a kindred spirit whose likes he has
                    never encountered before. They align emotionally closely in many
                    respects, understanding each other without words. One of the first
                    exchanges that occurs between them is brilliant and reveals this
                    perfectly:
                    <br /><br />
                    “He was playing with me. I knew he wasn’t French, just as he must
                    have immediately guessed I wasn’t either. Each was basically letting
                    the other think he could pass for French. A tacit compliment that
                    hit the mark in both of us...We understood each other perfectly”
                    (30). The narrator and Kalaj find themselves alone in an oasis of
                    calm in the eye of a foreign country, Café Algiers a safe haven for
                    each man to hide from their fears and alter egos, where they can
                    each feign for a moment at least that they belong. If not to a place,
                    then with another person.
                    <br /><br />
                    On the other hand, while in Kalaj the narrator finds a spirit close
                    to his heart, he manages at the same time to be completely alien
                    to the narrator.
                    <br /><br />
                    After Kalaj lures the narrator in and cements their friendship with
                    a round of coffee, the narrator observes, “I was the exact opposite
                    [kind of person]. Interest in other people came naturally enough
                    [for me]; but it came the long way around, with so many bends,
                    hurdles, doubts, and deferrals that halfway toward a friendship,
                    discouragement and disappointment would invariably settle in, and
                    something in me would simply give up” (32). Reflecting upon his
                    social ineptitude, the narrator muses, “Never had I felt so useless
                    and callow in ordinary day-to-day affairs. I was a flea tagging after
                    a titan” (45).

                  However, as the story progresses and the narrator spends more and more
                  time with Kalaj, he gradually comes to the realization although Kalaj
                  has a startling polarity to his personality, for all their differences
                  the reason why he feels such a strong attraction and deep understanding
                  with him is that in him

                    In a later passage, the narrator states difference after difference
                    between himself and that disheveled cabbie. However, with every word
                    the thought remains, unspoken, that despite each and every one of
                    those divisions the narrator sees himself clearly in the other man.
                    <br /><br />
                    “I was shifty, he was up-front. I never raised my voice; he was
                    the loudest man on Harvard Square. I was cramped, cautious, diffident;
                    he was reckless and brutal, a tinderbox. He spoke his mind. Mine
                    was a vault. He was in-your-face; I waited till your back was
                    turned. He stood for nothing, took no prisoners, lambasted everyone.
                    I tolerated everybody without loving a single one. He wore love on his
                    sleeve; mine was buried layers deep, and even then… He was new to the
                    States but had managed to speak to almost everyone in Cambridge; I’d
                    been a graduate student for four years at Harvard but went entire days
                    that summer without a soul to turn to. When he was upset or bored,
                    he bristled, fidgeted, then he exploded; I was the picture of
                    composure. He was absolute in all things; compromise was my name.
                    Once he started there was no stopping him, whereas the slightest
                    blush would stop me in my tracks. He could dump you and never
                    think twice of it; I’d make up in no time, then spite you forever
                    after. He could be cruel. I was seldom kind. Neither of us had
                    any money, but there were days when I was far, far poorer than he.
                    For him there was no shame in poverty; he had come from it. For
                    me, shame had deep pockets, deeper even than identity itself,
                    because it could take your life, your soul and bore its way in
                    and turn you inside out like an old sock and expose you for who
                    you’d finally turned into till you had nothing to show for yourself
                    and couldn’t stand a thing about yourself and made up for it by
                    scorning everything else. He was proud to know me, while, outside
                    of our tiny café society, I never wanted to be seen with him. He
                    was a cabdriver, I was Ivy League. He was an Arab, I was a Jew.
                    Otherwise we could have swapped roles in a second” (51).

                  Aciman’s portrayal of Kalaj as the narrator’s foil in a most literal
                  sense is excellent. Throughout the novel’s introduction to this character,
                  the narrator goes through a spectrum of reactions, pulling the reader along
                  in his slapdash assessments of Kalaj until it slowly dawns on him that
                  this bedraggled caricature of a man is really him.
                  <br /><br />
                  Harvard Square is a masterpiece that manages to cut to the core of the identity
                  crisis relevant to anyone struggling to fit into a new society and set of
                  expectations. Aciman paints the characters in the story of the narrator’s
                  life with beautiful strokes and winding prose that helps the reader
                  empathize and resonate with the central storyline on a level that strikes
                  extremely deeply. A narrative that struggles with class differences, race
                  differences, identity, and relationships, Aciman captures perfectly the
                  meandering hopes and fears eminently relatable to anyone feeling a little
                  loss in this day and age.
