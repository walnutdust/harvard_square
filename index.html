          Human progression has never been straightforward or linear. Variations
          to the status quo have to be introduced, withstand the test
          of time and societal norms, before they can hope to be widely adopted.
          Cryptocurrency is just another one of society’s experiments; it is therefore
          to our benefit to follow scientific protocol, and properly understand its
          origins, development, and potential impacts.

              Consider Alice and Bob.
              <br /><br />
              In simpler days, if Alice and her tribe wanted to survive together in the
              wild, the easiest manner by which to do so would be to work together and
              share the benefits over an evening bonfire. This, though grossly simplified,
              is an idea propagated by Karl Marx and Communism.
              <br /><br />
              As society developed and means of travel became more sophisticated,
              communities based in different locations became more interconnected. Bartering
              evolved as a result for both communities to benefit from their produce at
              home. Alice, could trade her apples for Bob’s fish, at a mutually agreed
              exchange rate.
              <br /><br />
              Yet, bartering was an imperfect means of trading. If Alice wanted Bob’s
              fish in the winter (where Bob would have difficulty with seasonal shortage),
              or Bob had wanted Alice’s apples in the summer, where the trees were not
              yet fully grown, neither trade would have been possible. Alice and
              Bob now had

            <p>
              <br /><br />
              In economic terms, the problem occurs due to the improbability of two
              traders wishing to trade their skills or products at a similar time
              in an economy fuelled only by barter trade.
              <br /><br />
              To deal with this situation, Alice would trade her apples for Charlie’s
              bushels of wheat at a mutually agreed ratio. With the wheat now acting as
              an intermediate buffer, Alice is now able to obtain Bob’s fishes in the
              other seasons, and vice versa. Unknowingly, Alice, Bob, and Charlie
              contributed to the development of the concept of money. In modern
              monetary economics definitions,

        Money was created to fulfil
          <a href = "https://books.google.com.au/books?id=sSY9AAAAQBAJ">three functions:</a>
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <ol>
          <li>Medium of Exchange</li>
          <li>Units of Account</li>
          <li>Storage of Value</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Early trading often relied on livestock or produce as
          <div class = "panel">
            <p>
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class = "accordion"><p>commodity money</p></button>
          <div class = "panel">
            <p>
              , because these were the most conveninient choices around. However,
              oxen could fall ill and die, while produce goes bad eventually. The
              perishability of these commodity money reduced their function as a
              storage of value
            </p>
          </div>

          . Precious metals became the next step forward, because
          they were non-perishable, hard to obtain, and

          <div class = "panel">

            <p>
              <br /><br />
              If you traded in
              terms of oxen, how do you buy half an oxen worth of items? By measuring the
              weight of metals, they could be divided accordingly for the purchase of an
              item. Central authorities started grabbing onto this idea, and forged them
              into common denominations to further increase their convenience. Coinage can
              be traced back to roughly
              <a href = "http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnMME7.html#firstpage-bar">900 B.C.
              </a>

                 600 B.C</a> in Greece.
              <br /><br />
              While coinage was decidedly more suitable as a medium of exchange than oxen and wheat, as
              society progressed and started producing items and services of a greater
              value, it became necessary to innovate to avoid having to lug huge amounts
              of metal for large purchases.
              </p>
          </div>
          Paper notes for larger denominations of value
          became the next step forward, and are what we commonly use today.

          But laziness defines all humans, and


          <div class = "panel">
            <p>
              while traditional money worked well for purchases, people started
            wondering if there was a more convenient system to handle frequent transactions.
            To fulfil this need,

            <p>
              <br /><br />
              Instead of having the money swap hands all the time, they started keeping a
              record of all the transactions. Now, when Dion buys an apple from Alice
              for 1 dollar, the record will note: ‘Dion pays Alice 1 dollar’. At
              the end of every month, all of them will come together and review the
              record. If they have a negative balance, they contribute into the pot. If
              they have a positive balance, they withdraw from the pot. Due to the zero-sum
              nature of the record ledger, the system is guaranteed to work, if everybody
              follows the rules.

        <h1>Distrust, Father of Currency</h1>
        <p>Increased convenience provides increased ease of greed, and therefore
          greater distrust amongst users. Modern transaction systems therefore
          have to show their users that they are reliable against potential attacks,
          frauds, or shocks.

              <br /><br />
              Security measures are in the form of authentication, such as requiring
              a signature to verify cheques, the CVV (Card Verification Value)/CSC
              (Card Security Code) on your credit cards, and PIN (Personal Identification Number).
              These measures serve as a deterrence to potential attackers, and
              help to ensure that you are in posession of what you have earned and
              deposited with them.

                Central Banks, and to a greater extent fiat currency, are as much political constructs as they are
                  economic constructs. They provide an avenue through which policymakers and
                  financial institutions may enact policies to manipulate and regulate
                  expenditure. The details are sufficiently long to warrant an article by

          Increasing distrust for the central bank has resulted in calls for decentralisation of currency.
          <br /><br />
          However, several procedural questions have to be answered before effective decentralisation
          can occur.

            <li>Given that it is likely through digital means, how do we ensure the

              the user than necessary)?</li>
            <li>Clearly, if the move to decentralisation was done to avoid needing to
              trust any one entity in particular, how do we keep track of transactions?</li>
            <li>If there are any conflicts, how do we address them?</li>
            <li>How do we avoid fraud?</li>

        <h1>Creation of Bitcoin</h1>
        <p>In 2009, an unknown programmer Satoshi Nakamoto
          <a href = "https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">proposed a solution to
          decentralised currency.</a>. The simplified protocol functions in four steps:</p>
          <br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Set-up.</strong> Each user in the system has a public key and a private key.
              They also keep track of every transaction that has taken place, much
              alike a ‘ledger’.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction.</strong> Every potential transaction is authorised by the payer
              by the private key, and this authorisation is verifiable with knowledge
              of only the public key.</li>
            <li><strong>Blockchain.</strong> Multiple unprocessed transactions are drawn, and a ‘miner’
              forms a block with them. The ‘miner’ then finds a string that fulfils
              certain criterias, and propagate the block on the network.</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution.</strong> If conflicting ‘ledgers’ are detected, then
              every user will keep track of every copy, and select the longest chain
              where possible.</li>

                    Due to the complexity of the key pair,
                    it is almost impossible to regain your key pair with no information
                    whatsoever. If you happen to lose the key pair (e.g. due to transferring
                    from one desktop to another), then all the currency in it is lost. A

                    This is an important figure to note, because the Bitcoin algorithm only
                    generates 21 million Bitcoins in its lifetime, so the above-mentioned amount
                    accounts for more than 10% of the entire future Bitcoin economy.

          <br /><br />
          <p>Say Dion wishes to give Ephraem 10 Bitcoins. He will generate
            a message containing the transaction details, and provide

            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
              </p>
            </div>
            <button class = "accordion"><p> authentication.</p></button>
            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
                <br /><br />
                Authentication over the digital realm is an interesting question. In an
                arena where all data can be represented by bits of ‘1’ and ‘0’s, how
                might we provide authentication in a meaningful manner without the risk
                of attackers stealing it?
                <br /><br />
                Cryptography comes to the rescue. In the study of cryptography we are
                exposed to functions which are easy to compute in one direction but not
                the other. An example is the computation of square roots. While it is
                easy to verify if the answer is correct (by multiplying it by itself),
                it is much harder to obtain the square root.
                <br /><br />
                Bitcoin uses an algorithm known as the
                <a href = "http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.37.2771">Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
                Algorithm</a> (ECDSA). Through this algorithm, the user is able
                to generate a 'digital signature' with his private key and the
                transaction details. This 'digital signature' can be easily authenticated by other
                users with only knowledge of the transaction details and the public key,
                while it is computationally intensive for another user to
                figure out what the secret key is.
                <br /><br />
              </p>
            </div>

            At this point in time, the transaction is not yet 'confirmed'. However,
            it is added to a pool consisting of all the other 'unconfirmed'
            transactions made on the network.

          <strong>3. Blockchain, Conflict Resolution, and Fraud Prevention</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <p>Now that we have generated transactions, we need to figure out a protocol
            to add them into the digital ledger that allows us to address conflicts and
            prevent fraud.
            <br /><br />
            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
                To do this, we draw inspiration from the days of commodity money.
                <br /><br />
                As previously mentioned, early commodity money was in the form of livestock
                and produce. Why was it that we were perfectly fine with people rearing
                more livestock or harvesting more produce but not when people tried to
                counterfeit notes? <br /><br />
              </p>
            </div>
            <button class = "accordion"><p>The answer, we suggest, is work.</p></button>
            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
                <br /><br />
                While it requires a lot of work from the user to rear livestock or plant
                more produce, counterfeiting money as a task possesses relatively less
                barriers. We were happy to award the farmers accordingly by letting them
                use the livestock or produce as money.
                <br /><br />
                To emulate that in a Cryptocurrency, we make computers solve
                computationally intensive tasks to show a 'proof of work'. This
                idea was used since 1997, although back then it was known as
                <a href = "http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf">Hashcash</a>
                , and it was created to counter spammers
                by asking for

                <div class = "panel">
                  <p>
                  </p>
                </div>
                <button class = "accordion"><p>partial hash collisions.</p></button>
                <div class = "panel">
                  <p>
                    <br /><br />
                    Partial hash collisions demanded a hash (encoded message, Hashcash uses
                    the Secure Hash Algorithm-1, or SHA-1) that matches partially with another
                    string. For example, in Hashcash, if an email was sent at 2003
                    June 26th by adam@cypherspace.org, then the computer will go
                    through all possibilities to determine a string (line of text) like this:
                    <br /><br />
                    <code>0:030626:adam@cypherspace.org:xxxxxxxx</code>
                    <br /><br />
                    where the computer will loop through all possibilities of the
                    'xxxxxxx' to find a string that when encoded in SHA-1, produces
                    a hash that starts with '0's.
                    <br /><br />
                    The reason why this worked was because SHA-1 produces a very
                    different output even if the input changes a little. As an example, the
                    empty string (line of characters) produces the following SHA-1 hash:
                    <br /><br />
                    <code>da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709</code>
                    <br /><br />
                    whereas the string ‘a’ produces the following SHA-1 hash:
                    <br /><br />
                    <code>86f7e437faa5a7fce15d1ddcb9eaeaea377667b8</code>
                    <br /><br />
                    Take for instance the string ‘AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA’, which
                    when encoded in SHA-1, produces:
                    <br /><br />
                    <code>e04976c6e1ce44aa1840b07b57021c158a11eafc</code>
                    <br /><br />
                    whereas the string ‘AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB’ produces:
                    <br /><br />
                    <code>427b014d063769f93d018c7ed1336cd77edaf38d</code>
                    <br /><br />
                    The output changes in a fashion which cannot be reliably predicted by
                    computers or algorithms today, so the only way to determine the string
                    from the hash is through pure guesswork. To complete the example above,
                    a possible string could be:
                    <br /><br />
                    <code>0:030626:adam@cypherspace.org:6470e06d773e05a8</code>
                    <br /><br />
                    Which, when encoded in SHA-1, gives us:
                    <br /><br />
                    <code>00000000c70db7389f241b8f441fcf068aead3f0</code>
                    <br /><br />
                    It is worth noting that we are capable of modifying the computational
                    difficulty by specifying a different condition. For example, we could
                    require the system to match the first 12 digits to be '0's. Each additional
                    digit increases the difficulty (and therefore the time taken) by approximately
                    16 times. Interestingly, while methods like these are use in encryption,
                    there has been no rigorous proof that cracking (deriving the inverse
                    function of) the Secure Hash Algorithm is impossible.

                B-money failed to establish how agreement on the digital ledger

            <br /><br />
            This was the reason why Bitcoin was thought of as revolutionary. It
            established a protocol which ensured that:
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Verification could be done by any user on the network.</li>
            <li>No trust on any one user or group was required.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The protocol works as follows:
            <br /><br />
            Firstly, unconfirmed transactions are gathered as a group into a 'block'.
            <br /><br />
            Next, computers seek the 'solution'


            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
                , a string to append to the end of the block that
                allows the SHA-256 hash of the block to fulfil a partial hash collision
                (i.e. the starting characters of the hash are '0's).
                <br /><br />
                It is worth noting for Bitcoin that modifications will be made
              </p>
            </div>
            <button class = "accordion"><p> to the computational puzzle</p></button>

              <p>
              every 2016 blocks (roughly two weeks) by increasing the difficulty
              of the partial hash collision such that it takes approximately
                10 minutes for each block to be found. This is an important feature
                because of Moore’s Law suggesting that computing power doubles every two
                years, and Bitcoin is structured such that new Bitcoins enter the system
                in a orderly, predictable manner unperturbed by external factors
              </p>
            </div>
            .

            <br /><br />
            When a match is found, the computer that determines the 'solution' is given
            Bitcoins as reward, and propagates the block to the rest of the network.
            Due to the work involved in finding the match, these computers are known
            as ‘miners’. 'Blocks' are then linked together to form a

            <div class = "panel">

            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
                This linking is done by appending the 'solution' of the previous
                'block' to the header of the next 'block'. As SHA algorithms produce
                an unpredictable output if the input is altered even slightly, this
                means that no attacker can easily alter the ledger, or history of
                transactions, without having to re-compute all the 'solutions'
                again.

            If users in the network have conflicts in their 'ledger', they elect
            to trust the 'ledger' with more 'work' done, or in this case, the
            longest 'blockchain'. If two conflicting chains of the
            same length are detected, then users will keep track of both 'blockchain's
            until one of them is longer than the other by an

            <strong>Fraud Prevention</strong>
            <br /><br />
            Now, let us consider what might need to happen if, say, Ephraem, decides
            to want to cheat Alice by double spending money.
            <br /><br />
            For this to work, Ephraem will make a transaction to Alice, wait until
            Alice accepts the transaction as valid, then subsequently injecting a
            longer valid block chain. As the community is dependent on the proof of
            work, if Ephraem can pull this off, he will technically be able to ‘erase’
            his transaction with Alice.
            <br /><br />
            From the above, for Ephraem to do this, he has to come up with a consecutive
            chain of 6 blocks by himself, faster than the rest of the world working
            on it. While he may get lucky the first or even the second time, it is
            near impossible to replicate the efforts 6 times

            <div class = "panel">

                <br /><br />
                However, the above assumes that Ephraem is working alone. In
                reality, miners usually work together in a group, known as a ‘mining
                guild’. Each miner contributes computing power, and any Bitcoin earned
                is shared amongst everyone in the guild, which allows for more reliable
                returns on mining. BTC Guild, currently the largest Bitcoin mining guild,
                has obtained 6 consecutive blocks in a row

                conducts its mining operations legitimately, the fact that this
                situation has occurred shows us that the potential that a determined group of people may spoil

                a middleman in such a scenario therefore reduces transaction fees, and

            A visceral response for policymakers might be to impose a strict ban on
            Cryptocurrencies, but such an approach

            <div class = "panel">

              <p>
                With the widespread adoption of Cryptocurrencies at the present,
                and the peer-to-peer nature of implementation, it is almost impossible to
                impose a blanket ban. Consider as analogy the laws against content piracy
                via torrents. Legal authorities face huge difficulties in tracking down
                users torrenting copyrighted materials, and are therefore unable to execute
                the laws in a meaningful manner. Like Cryptocurrencies, the act of torrenting
                itself is not illegal, but the potential for abuse is present and should
                be discouraged.
                <br /><br />
              </p>
            </div>




            Policymakers may consider instead to turn their attention to the entry and exit ramps
            <a href = "https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=140021013065023101107070091121000120105018010061023037119086119064086014000027019000035020062104054111107001085002107104031026037007090023044113120028068113084118070054065073120030096113097078012067096086092017018127000104099011071109108082108030009066&EXT=pdf">, where Cryptocurrencies are exchanged for fiat currencies.</a>
            Not only do these ramps serve as chokepoints for legal authorities to focus
            their efforts on, it seems likely that regulation, rather than a strict ban
            will allow for communities to harness the benefits that Cryptocurrencies
            provide.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>2. Privacy and Vulnerability</strong>
            <br /><br />
            In theory, Cryptocurrency users need not reveal any personal information
            to operate in a network.
            <br /><br />
            In practice, however, there are many avenues through which a user’s public
            address and his or her identity


            <div class = "panel">
              <p>

            </div>
            <button class = "accordion"><p>can be linked. </p></button>
            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
                A 2017 research concluded that various strategies were capable of identifying
                <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04748">up to 60% of Bitcoin </a>
                users of the MyBitcoin service. Vulnerabilities exist both in the network
                (through identifying and tracing transactions) and out of the network
                (posting public keys on forums, IP addresses, geographical information,
                etc) which when combined would offer the potential of unmasking the
                identity of a user.
              </p>
            </div>

            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, while Cryptocurrencies were developed such that no trust
            needs to be placed in human agencies, people end up placing their faith
            in various entities such as online wallet services. People would then pay
            for it when
            <a href = "http://observer.com/2011/08/mybitcoin-spokesman-finally-comes-forward-what-did-you-think-we-did-after-the-hack-we-got-shitfaced/">
            MyBitcoin shut down, resulting in losses of 154,406 Bitcoins</a>,
            or when
            <a href = "https://www.wired.com/2014/02/bitcoins-mt-gox-implodes-2/">Mt. Gox lost 744,408 Bitcoins in a hack
            </a>. The huge financial
            incentives for attackers, alongside immature security technology, makes
            Bitcoin exchanges a tempting target.
            <br /><br />
            Users of current Cryptocurrency networks are therefore cautioned: Though
            the network itself may be relatively private and self-secure, the logistics
            involved in operating in the network may result in opening up a different
            can of worms.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>3. Tax Evasion</strong>
            <br /><br />
            While the Bitcoin white paper was only published in 2009, the creation of
            a digital currency was
            <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2mdYX1nF_Y">predicted back in 1999</a> by Nobel Laureate Milton
            Friedman. He predicted that such an innovation would be motivated by

              <p>
              -  when trades
              happened behind the veil of cryptography, the government has a harder time
              imposing the appropriate taxes. Cryptocurrency thus provides a
              <a href = "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2305863">tax haven</a>
              </p>
            </div>

            .
            <br /><br />
            However, taxes were created as a means to fund public goods and services,
            which suffer the
            <a href ="https://archive.org/details/twolecturesonch00lloygoog">tragedy of the commons</a>
            .
            How societies adopting Cryptocurrency address the funding of shared
            infrastructure and services will likely play a large part to whether or not
            Cryptocurrencies can be sustainably adopted as the de facto currency in the
            long term.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>4. Adoption as a Global Currency</strong>
            <br /><br />
            If money serves to act as an intermediary to facilitate transactions, why
            not extend its effectiveness by creating a global currency, one that is
            not bounded by politics or society? This question is multi-faceted, and
            can only be insufficiently explored in this essay.
            <br /><br />
            Various economic and monetary unions have been explored and used in the
            past and present, the most well-recognised examples are the Euro and the
            US Dollar. The formation of economic and monetary unions have also been

            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
                , with one of the more well-known works
                being Mundell’s theory on
                <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1812792?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Optimum Currency Areas</a>
                , further developed by
                <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243672849_The_Theory_of_Optimum_Currency_Areas_An_Eclectic_View">Kenen</a>
                 and
                 <a href = "http://www.jstor.org/stable/1811021">McKinnon</a>
                 . Optimum Currency Areas analyse the potential of geographical
                 neighbours forming an economic or monetary union through adoption
                 of a common currency. It argues that a successful currency
                union requires four criteria: Labour mobility, Capital mobility, Risk-sharing
                system, and Common business cycles.
                <br /><br />
                The 2009 European Sovereign Debt Crisis highlighted the importance of
                some of these criteria. Originally, the European Monetary Union enacted
                a clause that called for a no-bailout policy, intended to ensure that
                the growth of countries in the union will not be dragged down by other
                countries. In 2010, however, the <a href = "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/greece-takes-bailout-but-doubts-for-region-persist/">
                European committee realised that this was unfeasible</a>
                and unsustainable. Without any means to help the Euro pull through
                shocks together, the currency union bears no meaning in crises.
                To attest to this, the stability of the US Dollar is commonly
                attributed to the mechanisms which are in
                place to allow the Federal Government of the United States to provide
                <a href = "https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=719105092024098117125097018082000118038069081083039091121092121090087104098067027066123029119022059121027023078086080089091076017078060077029073103079083000119094047065040118001073008085097090001020031092079098011008070124127100097027080001007087124&EXT=pdf">

            </div>
            .
            <br /><br />
            It is unclear, in the hands of a currency unmanaged by any central
            authority, how economic shocks will play out. Will regional boundaries
            matter? Will concepts like ‘country’ increase or diminish in significance?
            <br /><br />
            <strong>5. Usage of non-fiat currencies</strong>
            <br /><br />
            Intentionally or not, the world has already seen attempts to introduce
            money outside fiat currencies

            <div class = "panel">

                or ramen</a> used as money for other objects;
                <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/01/14/why-would-drug-dealers-use-tide-as-a-currency/tide-is-the-must-steal-product-of-the-season">Tide detergent bottles </a>
                were noted to have been used by drug dealers. These currencies see localised usage as
                a method

            </div>



            <br /><br />
            In online games we also see the introduction of

            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
                virtual currencies.
                These monetary systems are constructs meant to facilitate the game’s economy, as another
                ends for players to work towards. Yet, in recent times it has been noted
                that these virtual currencies could also be treated as an alternate currency.
                While often small in impact, Second Life (which was registered to have a
                million active users per month) and its in-game currency Linden Dollars
                have came under scrutiny. A 2012 European Central Bank report was
                published to
                <a href ="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf">

            <button class = "accordion"><p> virtual currencies. While most of them were limited in impact, </p></button>

              <p>
                this was provided that the scope and adoption continued to be limited.
                Optimistically, the report even predicted that such schemes would increase
                financial innovation and provide users with greater convenience. In 2015
                another report was published,
                <a href = "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemesen.pdf">finding that risks are entailed when dealing
                with these systems, but otherwise sees no need to provide modifications to
                the current legal framework</a>.

            Tencent’s QQ-coins (alternatively named Q-coins) were
            judged by China’s central government to be


            <div class = "panel">
              <p>

            </div>
            <button class = "accordion"><p>potentially destabilising on the central currency. </p></button>
            <div class = "panel">
              <p>
                In contrast to Linden Dollars, QQ-coins were introduced
                as an acceptable payment method for auctions on Taobao.com, and were noted
                to have been involved in cases where gamblers attempted to circumvent the
                country’s strict anti-gambling laws.
                <br /><br />
                With their adoption becoming more commonplace, the currency substitution
                effect of Cryptocurrencies can not be neglected. An increasing lean towards
                such payment methods will see a reduction in central banks’ ability to
                influence short-term interest rates, which limits measures to encourage or
                discourage growth based on a country’s position.
                <br /><br />
              </p>
            </div>

            It can be argued that this was the ultimate aim for Cryptocurrencies: a
            decentralisation of financial power which ultimately meant that central
            banks and authorities have less power to control such situations. It has
            to be remembered, however, that the world has yet to see a large-scale
            substitution on a global level, and how situations play out in the interim
            is not yet known.
            <br /><br />
            While we are only capable of speculation at this point, we should
            indubitably seek to understand Cryptocurrency, and attempt to see how
            its ideologies
